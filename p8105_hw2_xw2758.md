## Problem 1

``` r
trashwheel_df = read_xlsx(
  "~/R_columbia/p8105/p8105_hw2_xw2758/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
mutate(
  sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
  sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
)
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "~/R_columbia/p8105/p8105_hw2_xw2758/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "~/R_columbia/p8105/p8105_hw2_xw2758/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

First, I read and clean the NYC Transit data.

``` r
subway_data = read_csv("~/R_columbia/p8105/p8105_hw2_xw2758/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE))
```

**Briefly explain**

  - This dataset is about NYC subway information, including station
    name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending,
    entrance type, and so on.

  - I just use janitor to make colnames tidy and select some interesting
    columns. Also, I turn some character variable into logical variable
    by using recode function.

  - This dataset has 1868 rows and 19 columns. And it is not tidy.

**Answer some questions by using these data**

``` r
distinct_station = distinct(subway_data, line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

  - There are 465 distinct stations.

  - 468 stations are ADA compliant.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
no_vending = filter(subway_data, vending == "NO")
have_entry = filter(no_vending, entry == T)
```

  - The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.3770492.

**Let’s reformat the data\!**

``` r
tidy_station = distinct_station %>%
  mutate_at(vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
               names_to = "route_name",
               values_to = "route_number")
  routenumberA = filter(tidy_station, route_number == "A")
  adacom = filter(routenumberA, ada == TRUE)
```

  - 60 distinct stations serve the A train

  - Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

**Read and clean data in plos-monthin**

``` r
poles_month_df = read.csv("~/R_columbia/p8105/p8105_hw2_xw2758/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(year:day), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "January", "2" = "February", "3" = "March", "4" = "April", "5" ="May", "6" = "June", "7" = "July", "8" = "August", "9" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December")) %>%
  mutate(
    president = case_when(
      prez_gop == "1" ~ "gop",
      prez_dem == "1" ~ "dem"
  )) %>% 
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)
```

**Next, read and clean data in snp**

``` r
snp_df = read.csv("~/R_columbia/p8105/p8105_hw2_xw2758/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(year:day), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "January", "2" = "February", "3" = "March", "4" = "April", "5" ="May", "6" = "June", "7" = "July", "8" = "August", "9" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December")) %>% 
  select(-day) %>%
  relocate(year, month)
```

**Then, read and clean data in unemployment**

``` r
unemployment_df = read.csv("~/R_columbia/p8105/p8105_hw2_xw2758/unemployment.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unem_percentage") %>%
      mutate(month = recode(month, "jan" = "January", "feb" = "February", "mar" = "March", "apr" = "April", "may" ="May", "jun" = "June", "jul" = "July", "aug" = "August", "sep" = "September", "oct" = "October", "nov" = "November", "dec" = "December"))
```

**Join three datasets**

``` r
final_df = poles_month_df %>%
  left_join(snp_df, by = c("year","month")) %>%
  left_join(unemployment_df, by = c("month","year"))
```

**Last explain**

  - Pols-month has 9 variables and 822observation. The range of year is
    1947, 2015.

  - Snp has 3 variables and 787observation. The range of year is 1950,
    2015

  - Pols-month has 9 variables and 822observation. The range of year is
    1947, 2015.

  - Unemployment has 3 variables and 816observation. The range of year
    is 1948, 2015.

  - Final result joint dataset has 11 variables and 822observation. The
    range of year is 1947, 2015. It has some key varibles, including
    year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem,
    rep\_dem, president, close, unem\_percentage.
